HOW TO CONFIGURE:

Basically you will need a txt file called "DicionarioLista.txt"
in your documents directory, otherwise it will not work.

If you were confused, open the steps folder and follow the images, at the end there will be a
txt file identical to the one mentioned above, copy and paste it in the documents directory.

HOW TO USE:

You can basically add words, and their translations.
the program will write to a txt file called "DicionarioLista.txt".

You can also search for a word that you have previously stored.
The program will quickly return the result to the screen.

You can also delete, either by typing something in the bar below the list, or by
selecting and pressing remove.

FUTURE THINGS:

The list on the side, called description in the future will be functional, so you can
can not only store the words and translations but also their descriptions
personal information about them.


Right now, I hope you make good use of the program, and that it helps you a lot.
this program was made with the intention of helping me to learn a new language!
